# Cyberpatriot-Project
My independent study project
There is a "Main" script for both Linux and Windows. This will take care of both Operating System's basic funtions such as:
- Firewall Configuration
- Password Policy
- Disabling insecure servers
- Enabling updates
- Removing non-work related files
(The functions are all commented in the code)

In the Linux folder, there is a script that takes an input of the Administrators and Authorized Users, and takes care of administrator privledge and makes sure all of the users have secure passwords
